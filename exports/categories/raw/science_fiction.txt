Hal NP
Yarrow NP

among IN
the AT

among IN
the AT

He PPS

And CC
, ,
from IN
the AT
first RB
, ,
he PPS
faced VBD
a AT
difficult JJ
task NN

The AT
expedition NN
that WPS

discovered VBN
Ozagen NP
had HVD
succeeded VBN
in IN
correlating VBG
two CD
thousand CD
Siddo NP
words NNS
with IN
an AT
equal JJ
number NN
of IN
American JJ

The AT
description NN
of IN
the AT
Siddo NP
syntax NN
was BEDZ
very QL
restricted VBN
. .
And CC
, ,
as CS
Hal NP
found VBD
out RP
, ,
obviously RB
mistaken VBN
in IN
many AP
cases NNS

This DT
discovery NN
caused VBD
Hal NP
anxiety NN

His PP$
duty NN
was BEDZ
to TO
write VB
a AT
school NN
text NN
and CC
to TO
teach VB
the AT
entire JJ
personnel NNS
of IN
the AT
Gabriel NP
how WRB
to TO
speak VB
Ozagen NP

Yet RB
, ,
if CS
he PPS
used VBD
all ABN
of IN
the AT
little AP
means NNS
at IN
his PP$
disposal NN
, ,
he PPS
would MD
be BE
instructing VBG
his PP$
students NNS
wrongly RB
. .
Moreover RB
, ,
even RB
getting VBG
this DT
across RB
would MD
be BE
difficult JJ
. .
For IN
one CD
thing NN
, ,
the AT
organs NNS
of IN
speech NN
of IN
the AT
Ozagen NP
natives NNS
differed VBD
somewhat RB
from IN
Earthmen's NPS$
; .
; .
the AT
sounds NNS
made VBN
by IN
these DTS
organs NNS
were BED
, ,
therefore RB
, ,
dissimilar JJ
. .
It PPS
was BEDZ
true JJ
that CS
they PPSS
could MD
be BE
approximated VBN
, ,
but CC
would MD
the AT
Ozagenians NPS
understand VB
these DTS
approximations NNS
? .
? .
Another DT
obstacle NN
was BEDZ
the AT
grammatical JJ
construction NN
of IN
Siddo NP
. .
Consider VB
the AT
tense NN
system NN
. .
Instead RB
of IN
inflecting VBG
a AT
verb NN
or CC
using VBG
an AT
unattached JJ
particle NN
to TO
indicate VB
the AT
past NN
or CC
future NN
, ,
Siddo NP
used VBD
an AT
entirely RB
different JJ
word NN
. .
Thus RB
, ,
the AT
masculine JJ
animate JJ
infinitive NN
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai FW-VB
, ,
meaning VBG
to TO
live VB
, ,
was BEDZ
, ,
in IN
the AT
perfect JJ
tense NN
, ,
ksu'u'peli'afo FW-VB
, ,
and CC
, ,
in IN
the AT
future NN
, ,
mai'teipa FW-NN
. .
The AT
same AP
use NN
of IN
an AT
entirely RB
different JJ
word NN
applied VBD
for IN
all ABN
the AT
other AP
tenses NNS
. .
Plus IN
the AT
fact NN
that CS
Siddo NP
not *
only RB
had HVD
the AT
normal JJ
( (
to IN
Earthmen NPS
) )
three CD
genders NNS
of IN
masculine JJ
, ,
feminine JJ
, ,
and CC
neuter JJ
, ,
but CC
the AT
two CD
extra JJ
of IN
inanimate JJ
and CC
spiritual JJ
. .
Fortunately RB
, ,
gender NN
was BEDZ
inflected VBN
, ,
though CS
the AT
expression NN
of IN
it PPO
would MD
be BE
difficult JJ
for IN
anybody PN
not *
born VBN
in IN
Siddo NP
. .
The AT
system NN
of IN
indicating VBG
gender NN
varied VBD
according RB
to IN
tense NN
. .
All QL
the AT
other AP
parts NNS
of IN
speech NN
: :
nouns NNS
, ,

, ,
adjectives NNS
, ,
adverbs NNS
, ,

operated VBD

as CS

This DT

not *
, ,
for IN
the AT
Angel NN-TL

just RB
a AT

running VBG
