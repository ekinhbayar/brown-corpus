just RB

He'll PPS+MD

But CC
they PPSS

Breeding NP-HL

Gentile NP

There's EX+BEZ
a AT

this DT

First OD
of IN
all ABN
, ,
the AT
admitting VBG
physician NN

the AT
VA NN

gets VBZ
the AT

as CS
a AT
new JJ
patient NN

He PPS
has HVZ
no AT

with IN
this DT

If CS
the AT
doctor NN
is BEZ
conscientious JJ
, ,
he PPS
wants VBZ
to TO
study VB
the AT

As CS
a AT
result NN

it PPS
takes VBZ
a AT
little QL
longer RBR
than CS
it PPS
would MD
on IN
the AT
outside NN
where WRB
the AT

physician NN

Secondly RB
, ,
the AT
VA NN
physician NN

that CS
when WRB

, ,
he PPS
is BEZ
no QL
longer RBR

a AT

So CS
he PPS

the AT

The AT

invaluable JJ

We PPSS

The AT

two CD
major JJ
liabilities NNS

First RB
, ,
it PPS
does DOZ
not *

A AT

restricted VBN

the AT
competing VBG

statements NNS

half ABN

Second RB
, ,
it PPS
subjects VBZ
the AT

distortion NN
by IN
the AT
unscrupulous JJ

The AT
charges NNS
by IN
the AT
late JJ
junior JJ
Senator NN-TL

not *
only RB
destroyed VBD
innocent JJ
people NNS

the AT

Yet RB
the AT

was BEDZ
powerless JJ
to TO
put VB
these DTS
charges NNS
in IN
perspective NN
in IN
its PP$
news NN
columns NNS

Despite IN
several AP
years NNS
of IN

, ,
the AT
average NN
citizen NN
was BEDZ
unable JJ
to TO
get VB
a AT
complete JJ
picture NN

McCarthy NP

what WDT
the AT

had HVD
been BEN
seeing VBG
all QL

no AT
effective JJ

The AT
Senator NN-TL
had HVD
boxed VBN
them PPO
in RP
with IN
their PP$
own JJ
restrictions NNS

It PPS
seems VBZ
to IN
me PPO
the AT
time NN
has HVZ
come VBN
for CS
the AT
American JJ
press NN
to TO
start VB
experimenting VBG
with IN
ways NNS

how WRB

the AT

In IN

the AT
