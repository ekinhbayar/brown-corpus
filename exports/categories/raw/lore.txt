In IN

One CD

the AT
reasons NNS

that CS

What WDT

noteworthy JJ
about IN
this DT

that CS

although CS

they PPSS

Perhaps RB

the AT

Second OD

the AT

The AT

In IN

The AT

How WRB

This DT

Vocational JJ-HL

I PPSS

four CD
points NNS
I PPSS
made VBD
in IN
my PP$
first OD
report NN
with IN
respect NN
to IN
vocational JJ
education NN

First OD
and CC
foremost RB
, ,
vocational JJ
courses NNS

not *
replace VB
courses NNS
which WDT
are BER
essential JJ
parts NNS
of IN
the AT
required VBN
academic JJ
program NN

Second OD
, ,
vocational JJ
courses NNS
should MD
be BE
provided VBN
in IN
grades NNS
11 CD

12 CD
and CC
not *
require VB
more AP
than IN
half ABN
the AT

time NN
in IN

; .
; .
however RB
, ,
for IN
slow JJ
learners NNS
and CC
prospective JJ
dropouts NNS
these DTS
courses NNS
ought MD
to TO
begin VB
earlier RBR
. .
Third OD
, ,
the AT
significance NN
of IN
the AT
vocational JJ
courses NNS
is BEZ
that CS
those DTS
enrolled VBN
are BER
keenly RB
interested VBN
in IN
the AT
work NN
; .
; .
they PPSS
realize VB
the AT
relevance NN
of IN
what WDT
they PPSS
are BER
learning VBG
to IN
their PP$
future JJ
careers NNS
, ,
and CC
this DT
sense NN
of IN
purpose NN
is BEZ
carried VBN
over RP

the AT
academic JJ

which WDT
they PPSS
are BER
studying VBG
at IN

time NN

Fourth OD

the AT
type NN

be BE
related VBN
to IN
the AT
employment NN
opportunities NNS
in IN
the AT
general JJ

This DT
last AP
point NN
is BEZ
important JJ
because CS

who WPS

the AT
whole JJ

Vocational JJ

which WDT

no AT
hope NN

Those DTS

the AT

I PPSS

To TO

the AT

two CD

Of IN

the AT

In IN

almost RB

In IN

I PPSS

it PPS

Somewhere NN

When WRB

But CC

short JJ

The AT

once RB

The AT

`` ``

This DT
way NN

unfortunate JJ

It PPS
implies VBZ
two CD

One CD
is BEZ
that CS

only RB

at IN
the AT
so-called JJ
`` ``

The AT
truth NN

however RB

that CS

The AT

misconception NN

that CS

if CS

However WQL

this DT

the AT

The AT

It PPS

The AT
idea NN

The AT
Jewish JJ
