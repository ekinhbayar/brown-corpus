When WRB

Observations NNS

Radio NN

The AT

much QL
higher JJR

This DT

a AT

For IN

the AT

Mars NP

The AT

No AT

The AT
study NN
of IN
the AT
radio NN

Dicke NP

This DT

Piddington NP

that CS

The AT

then RB

assumed VBN

Since CS

it PPS

Micelles NNS

Although CS

In IN

Then RB

This DT

those DTS

Whereas CS

Thus RB

for IN

From IN

so CS

so CS

For IN
each DT

let VB

Since CS

the AT

relatively RB

( (
Theorem NN-TL

Thus RB

Note VB

that CS

Since CS

we PPSS

We PPSS

for CS
if CS

then RB

It PPS

If CS

because CS

This DT

Conversely RB

let VB

Thus RB

Let VB

Then RB

The AT

uniquely RB

and CC
each DT

Proof NN-HL
. .-HL
We PPSS
have HV
just RB
observed VBN
that CS
we PPSS
can MD
write VB
Af NN
where WRB
D NN
is BEZ
diagonalizable JJ
and CC
N NN
is BEZ
nilpotent JJ
, ,
and CC
where WRB
D NN
and CC
N NN
not *
only RB
commute VB
but CC
are BER
polynomials NNS
in IN
T NN
. .
Now RB
suppose VB
that CS
we PPSS
also RB
have HV
Af NN
where WRB
D' NN
is BEZ
diagonalizable JJ
, ,
N' NN
is BEZ
nilpotent JJ
, ,
and CC
Af NN
. .
We PPSS
shall MD
prove VB
that CS
Af NN
. .
Since CS
D' NN
and CC
N' NN
commute VB
with IN
one CD
another DT
and CC
Af NN
, ,
we PPSS
see VB
that CS
D' NN
and CC
N' NN
commute VB
with IN
T NN
. .
Thus RB
D' NN
and CC
N' NN
commute VB
with IN
any DTI
polynomial NN
in IN
T NN
; .
; .
hence RB
they PPSS
commute VB
with IN
D NN
and CC
with IN
N NN
. .
Now RB
we PPSS
have HV
Af NN
or CC
Af NN
and CC
all ABN
four CD
of IN
these DTS
operators NNS
commute VB
with IN
one CD
another DT

Since CS
D NN
and CC
D' NN
are BER
both ABX
diagonalizable JJ
and CC
they PPSS
commute VB
, ,
they PPSS
are BER
simultaneously RB
diagonalizable JJ
, ,
and CC
Af NN
is BEZ
diagonalizable JJ
. .
Since CS
N NN
and CC
N' NN
are BER
both ABX
nilpotent JJ
and CC
they PPSS
commute VB
, ,
the AT
operator NN
Af NN
is BEZ
nilpotent JJ
; .
; .
for CS
, ,
using VBG
the AT
fact NN
that DT
N NN
and CC
N' NN
commute VB
Af NN
and CC
so RB
when WRB
R NP
is BEZ
sufficiently QL
large JJ
every AT
term NN
in IN
this DT
expression NN
for IN
Af NN
will MD
be BE
0 CD

( (
Actually RB
, ,
a AT
nilpotent JJ
operator NN
on IN
an AT
n-dimensional NN

must MD
have HV
its PP$

0 CD

if CS
we PPSS
take VB
Af NN
above RB
, ,
that DT
will MD
be BE
large JJ
enough QLP

It PPS
then RB
follows VBZ
that CS
Af NN
is BEZ
large JJ
enough QLP
, ,
but CC
this DT
is BEZ
not *
obvious JJ
from IN

expression NN

) )
Now RB
Af NN
is BEZ
a AT
diagonalizable JJ
operator NN
which WDT
is BEZ
also RB
nilpotent JJ
. .
Such ABL
an AT
operator NN
is BEZ
obviously RB
the AT
zero NN
operator NN
; .
; .
for CS
since CS
it PPS
is BEZ
nilpotent JJ
, ,
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
for IN
this DT
operator NN
is BEZ
of IN
the AT
form NN
Af NN
for IN
some DTI
Af NN
; .
; .
but CC
then RB
since CS
the AT
operator NN
is BEZ
diagonalizable JJ
, ,
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
cannot MD*
have HV
a AT
repeated VBN

; .
; .
hence RB
Af NN
and CC
the AT
minimal JJ
polynomial NN
is BEZ
simply RB
x NN
, ,
which WDT
says VBZ
the AT

0 CD

Thus RB
we PPSS

that CS

If CS

We PPSS

now RB
prove VB
several AP
lemmas NNS

Lemma NN-HL
1 CD-HL
. .-HL
In IN
some DTI
neighborhood NN
in IN
the AT
f-plane NN
of IN
any DTI
ordinary JJ
point NN
of IN
the AT
graph NN
, ,
the AT
function NN
f NN
is BEZ
a AT
single-valued JJ
, ,
continuous JJ
function NN
. .
Proof NN-HL
. .-HL
We PPSS
first RB
show VB
that CS
the AT
function NN
is BEZ
single-valued JJ
in IN
some DTI
neighborhood NN
. .
With IN
the AT
vertex NN
at IN
Af NN
in IN
the AT
C-plane NN
we PPSS
assume VB
that CS
Af NN
is BEZ
the AT
parametric JJ
location NN
on IN
C NN
of IN
an AT
ordinary JJ
intersection NN
Q NN
between IN
C NN
and CC
Af NN
. .
In IN
the AT
f-plane NN
the AT
coordinates NNS
of IN
the AT
corresponding JJ
point NN
are BER
Af NN
. .
We PPSS
know VB
that CS
in IN
the AT
C-plane NN
both ABX
C NN
and CC
Af NN
are BER
analytic JJ
. .
In IN
the AT
C-plane NN
we PPSS
construct VB
a AT
set NN
of IN
rectangular JJ
Cartesian JJ
coordinates NNS
u NN
, ,
V NP
with IN
the AT
origin NN
at IN
Q NN
and CC
such JJ
that CS
both ABX
C NN
and CC
Af NN
have HV
finite JJ
slope NN
at IN
Q NN
. .
Near IN
Q NN
, ,
both ABX
curves NNS
can MD
be BE
represented VBN
by IN
analytic JJ
functions NNS
of IN
U NP
. .
In IN
a AT
neighborhood NN
of IN
Q NN
the AT
difference NN
between IN
these DTS
functions NNS
is BEZ
also RB
a AT
single-valued JJ
, ,
analytic JJ
function NN
of IN
U NP
. .
Furthermore RB
, ,
one PN
can MD
find VB
a AT
neighborhood NN
of IN
Q NN
in IN
which WDT
the AT
difference NN
function NN
is BEZ
monotone JJ
, ,
for CS
since CS
it PPS
is BEZ
analytic JJ
it PPS
can MD
have HV
only RB
a AT
finite JJ
number NN
of IN
extrema NNS
in IN
any DTI
interval NN
. .
Now RB
, ,
to TO
find VB
Af NN
, ,
one PN
needs VBZ
the AT
intersection NN
of IN
C NN
and CC
Af NN
near IN
Q NN
. .
But CC
Af NN
is BEZ
just RB
the AT
curve NN
Af NN
translated VBN
without IN
rotation NN
through IN
a AT
small JJ
arc NN
, ,
for CS
Af NN
is BEZ
always RB
obtained VBN
by IN
rotating VBG
C NN
through IN
exactly RB
90-degrees NNS
. .
The AT
arc NN
is BEZ
itself PPL
a AT
segment NN
of IN
an AT
analytic JJ
curve NN
. .
Thus RB
if CS
E NP
is BEZ
sufficiently QL
small JJ
, ,
there EX
can MD
be BE
only RB
one CD
intersection NN
of IN
C NN
and CC
Af NN
near IN
Q NN
, ,
for CS
if CS
there EX
were BED
more AP
than IN
one CD
intersection NN
for IN
every AT
E NP
then RB
the AT
difference NN
between IN
C NN
and CC
Af NN
near IN
Q NN
would MD
not *
be BE
a AT
monotone JJ
function NN
. .
Therefore RB
, ,
Af NN
is BEZ
single-valued JJ
near IN
Q NN
. .
It PPS
is BEZ
also RB
seen VBN
that CS
Af NN
, ,
since CS
the AT
change NN
from IN
Af NN
to IN
Af NN
is BEZ
accomplished VBN
by IN
a AT
continuous JJ
translation NN
. .
Thus RB
Af NN
is BEZ
also RB
continuous JJ
at IN
Af NN
, ,
and CC
in IN
a AT
neighborhood NN
of IN
Af NN
which WDT
does DOZ
not *
contain VB
a AT
tangent JJ
point NN
. .
We PPSS
turn VB
now RB
to IN
the AT
set NN
of IN
tangent JJ
points NNS
on IN
the AT
graph NN
. .
This DT
set NN
must MD
consist VB
of IN
isolated VBN
points NNS
and CC
closed VBN
intervals NNS
. .
The AT
fact NN
that CS
there EX
can MD
not *
be BE
any DTI
limit NN

of IN
the AT
set NN
except IN
in IN
closed VBN

follows VBZ

the AT

Lemma NN-TL

that CS

the AT
C-plane NN
the AT

C NN

therefore RB
the AT

be BE
a AT
monotone JJ
function NN
in IN
some DTI

This DT

In IN

Proof NN-HL

A AT

A AT

There EX

Af NN
cuts VBZ

there EX

two CD

The AT

In IN

The AT

Again RB
, ,
the AT
analyticity NN

In IN

and CC

a AT

With IN

we PPSS

First RB

for IN
any DTI

f{t} NN

ordinary JJ

the AT

For CS
it PPS

clear JJ
that CS

Therefore RB

Suppose VB

Further RBR

that CS

Thus RB

Proof NN-HL

We PPSS
first RB
define VB
a AT

: :
given VBN
the AT

such JJ
that CS
each DT

three CD

b{t} NN

the AT

positive JJ
parametric JJ
differences NNS

The AT

the AT

Now RB
with IN

Af NN

Af-values NNS
occur VB
when WRB

Af NN
crosses VBZ
C NN
, ,

are BER
among IN
the AT

such JJ
that CS

The AT

just RB
the AT

We PPSS

define VB
g{t} NN
in IN
the AT

Thus RB
we PPSS
obtain VB

introducing VBG

Introduction NN-HL

In IN

These DTS

Then RB

A AT

On IN

the AT

the AT

The AT

the AT

Clearly RB

the AT

involutorial JJ

We PPSS
observe VB
first RB
that CS

l NN

can MD
meet VB
its PP$

except IN
at IN
one CD

For CS
if CS

the AT

would MD
contain VB
two CD

which WDT

impossible JJ

Moreover RB
, ,
from IN
the AT
definitive JJ
transformation NN
of IN
intercepts NNS
on IN
the AT

of IN
Af NN
, ,
it PPS
is BEZ
clear JJ
that CS
the AT
only AP
points NNS

Q NN
at IN
which WDT
a AT

can MD
meet VB
its PP$

are BER
the AT

Hence RB
the AT
totality NN
of IN

is BEZ
the AT
T NP

complex NN
of IN

The AT

the AT

the AT

, ,
since CS
each DT

these DTS

Q NN
in IN
two CD

which WDT

The AT

this DT

Af NN
, ,
since CS

( (

on IN
a AT
quadric JJ

pass VB

an AT
arbitrary JJ

The AT

the AT

is BEZ
Af NN
, ,
since CS
an AT
arbitrary JJ

**zg NN
in IN

Since CS

of IN

K NP

since CS
there EX

no AT

, ,
it PPS
follows VBZ
from IN
the AT
formula NN
Af NN
that CS
the AT

of IN
the AT

is BEZ
Af NN

There EX
are BER
various JJ
sets NNS
of IN
exceptional JJ

or CC

whose WP$

are BER
not *
unique JJ

The AT
most QL
obvious JJ
of IN
these DTS
is BEZ
the AT
quadratic JJ
complex NN
of IN
tangents NNS
to IN
Q NN
, ,
each DT

of IN
which WDT

transformed VBN
into IN
the AT

at IN
the AT

Thus RB
pencils NNS
of IN

transformed VBN

It PPS
is BEZ
interesting JJ
that CS

can MD
be BE
established VBN
between IN

so CS
that CS
in IN
a AT
sense NN
a AT
unique JJ

actually RB
be BE
assigned VBN

For CS
the AT

In IN

Moreover RB

if CS

two CD

a AT

tangent JJ

the AT

this DT

Af NN

Hence RB

thought VBN

any DTI

moreover RB
this DT

the AT

Each DT

This DT

Af NN
since CS

hence RB
every AT

since CS

every AT

The AT

A AT

Since CS

Since CS

we PPSS

What WDT

should MD
brief JJ

in IN
our PP$

We PPSS
should MD
first RB
recognize VB
our PP$
tendency NN
to TO
develop VB
a AT
hierarchy NN
of IN
values NNS
, ,
locating VBG
brief JJ

at IN

bottom NN
and CC
long-term NN

instead RB

the AT

as CS
part NN
of IN
a AT
continuum NN
, ,
each DT
important JJ
in IN
its PP$
own JJ
right NN
. .
This DT
problem NN
is BEZ
perhaps RB
as QL
old JJ
as CS
social JJ
casework NN
itself PPL

Almost RB
three CD

Bertha NP
Reynolds NP
undertook VBD
a AT
study NN
of IN
short-contact NN

because RB
of IN
her PP$
conviction NN
that CS

casework NN
had HVD
an AT
important JJ
but CC
neglected VBN
place NN
in IN
our PP$
network NN
of IN
social JJ
services NNS

Her PP$
conclusion NN
has HVZ
been BEN
borne VBN
out RP
in IN
the AT
experience NN
of IN
many AP
practitioners NNS
: :
`` ``

Thus RB
, ,
casework NN

still RB

According IN

All ABN

A AT

As CS

it PPO

`` ``

This DT

the AT

Thus RB

the AT

The AT

this DT

This DT

Many AP

for IN

By IN

In IN

The AT

Why WRB

For IN

Many AP

Incidentally RB

it PPS
needs VBZ
to TO
be BE
noted VBN
that CS
because CS

the AT

began VBD
increasing VBG

that CS

After IN
that DT

we PPSS

This DT
experimental JJ

represented VBD
quite ABL
a AT

It PPS

It PPS

44-year-old JJ
male NN

three CD

It PPS

premarital JJ

to IN
one CD

twelve CD

seemingly RB
unable JJ

One PN
might MD

at IN
this DT
point NN

speculate VB
that CS
if CS
it PPS

`` ``

to TO

Some DTI

But CC

the AT

the AT

different JJ
in IN

The AT

this DT

by IN
explaining VBG
his PP$
background NN

for IN
creating VBG
such ABL
a AT

in IN

He PPS

that CS
the AT

He PPS

build VB

`` ``

not *
encroach VB

`` ``

This DT

We PPSS

But CC
within IN
that DT

he PPS

A AT

Our PP$

Since CS

the AT

The AT

Since CS

this DT

he PPS

Thus RB

Nevertheless RB

From IN

The AT

in IN

While CS

Indeed RB

somewhat QL

We PPSS

under IN

because RB

that CS

It PPS

interesting JJ

note VB
that CS

made VBD
the AT

Our PP$

then RB

that CS

The AT

because CS

the AT

the AT

the AT

that CS

If CS

Thus RB

An AT

the AT

The AT

the AT

Much AP

not *
from IN
the AT
Federal JJ-TL

from IN
an AT

Proposals NNS-HL
State NN

encouraged VBN

a AT

There EX

a AT

an AT

information NN

help VB

state NN

departments NNS

local JJ

in IN

A AT
related VBN
question NN
is BEZ
whether CS
unemployed JJ
workers NNS
can MD
be BE
motivated VBN
to TO
take VB
the AT

There EX
is BEZ
little AP
evidence NN
that CS

have HV
any DTI
great JJ
difficulty NN
getting VBG

even RB
though CS

pay VB

a AT

However RB

there EX

is BEZ
some DTI
limit NN
to IN
the AT
numbers NNS
who WPS
will MD
spend VB
the AT
time NN
and CC
effort NN
to TO
acquire VB
training VBG
. .
Again RB
, ,
one CD
major JJ
difficulty NN
is BEZ
the AT
local JJ
focus NN

A AT
training VBG
program NN
in IN
a AT
depressed VBN
area NN
may MD
have HV
few AP
enrollees NNS
unless CS
there EX
is BEZ
some DTI
apparent JJ
prospect NN
for IN

opportunities NNS
afterwards RB
, ,
and CC
the AT
prospect NN
may MD
be BE
poor JJ
if CS
the AT
training NN
is BEZ
aimed VBN
solely RB
at IN
jobs NNS
in IN
the AT
local JJ
community NN

If CS
there EX

adequate JJ
information NN

opportunities NNS
for IN
skilled JJ
jobs NNS
elsewhere RB
, ,
many QL
more AP
workers NNS
can MD
be BE
expected VBN
to TO
respond VB
. .
Another DT
problem NN
is BEZ
who WPS
will MD
pay VB
for IN
the AT
training NN
. .
Local JJ
school NN
districts NNS
are BER
hard RB
pressed VBN
financially RB
and CC
unenthusiastic JJ
about IN
vocational JJ
training NN

Programs NNS
usually RB
are BER
expanded VBN
only RB
when WRB
outside JJ
funds NNS
are BER
available JJ
or CC
local JJ
business NN
leaders NNS
demand VB
it PPO

Even RB
industrial JJ

leaders NNS
find VB
it PPO
hard JJ
to TO
win VB
local JJ
support NN
for IN
training VBG
unless CS
a AT
new JJ
industry NN
is BEZ
in IN
sight NN
and CC
requests VBZ
it PPO
. .
State NN
governments NNS
have HV
been BEN
taking VBG
the AT
lead NN
in IN
establishing VBG
area NN
vocational JJ
schools NNS
, ,
but CC
their PP$
focus NN
is BEZ
still RB
on IN
area NN
job NN
opportunities NNS

Only RB
the AT
Federal JJ-TL
government NN
is BEZ
likely JJ
to TO
be BE
able JJ
to TO
take VB
a AT
long-run NN
and CC
nation-wide JJ
view NN
and CC
to TO
pay VB
for IN
training VBG
to TO
meet VB
national JJ
skilled JJ
manpower NN
needs NNS
. .
If CS
only AP
state NN
funds NNS
were BED
used VBN
to TO
pay VB
for IN
the AT
vocational JJ
education NN
, ,
it PPS
could MD
be BE
argued VBN
that CS
the AT
state NN
should MD
not *
have HV
to TO
bear VB
the AT
cost NN
of IN
vocational JJ
training NN
which WDT
would MD
benefit VB
employers NNS
in IN
other AP
states NNS
. .
However RB
, ,
if CS
Federal JJ-TL
funds NNS
are BER
used VBN
, ,
it PPS
would MD
be BE
entirely QL
appropriate JJ
to TO
train VB
workers NNS

jobs NNS
which WDT

be BE
obtained VBN
elsewhere RB
as QL
well RB
as CS
for IN
jobs NNS
in IN
the AT
area NN
of IN
chronic JJ

Such JJ

would MD
increase VB
the AT
tendency NN
of IN
workers NNS
to TO
leave VB
the AT
area NN
and CC
find VB
jobs NNS
in IN
other AP
localities NNS
. .
A AT
further JJR
possibility NN
is BEZ
suggested VBN
by IN
the AT
example NN
of IN
the AT
G. NP
I. NP
bills NNS
and CC
also RB
by IN
some DTI
recent JJ

that DT

to TO
provide VB
financial JJ
assistance NN
to IN
individuals NNS
for IN

training NN
when WRB

This DT
probably RB
would MD
require VB
some DTI
support NN
for IN
subsistence NN
as QL
well RB
as CS
for IN

, ,
but CC
the AT
total NN
would MD
be BE
no QL
greater JJR
than CS
for IN
the AT
proposals NNS
of IN
unemployment NN

or CC
a AT
Youth NN-TL
Conservation NN-TL
Corps NN-TL

A AT
maximum JJ
of IN
$600 NNS
per IN
year NN
per IN
student NN
would MD
enable VB
many AP
to TO
take VB

away RB
from IN

A AT

would MD
permit VB
placing VBG
emphasis NN
on IN
the AT
national JJ
interest NN
in IN

highly QL
skilled JJ

Instead RB
of IN
being BEG
limited VBN

the AT

the AT
student NN

Such JJ

This DT

part-time JJ
cooperative JJ

Personal JJ

His PP$

given VBN
more AP

But CC
briefly RB

the AT

examined VBN

Then RB
the AT
fact NN
that CS
the AT
lower JJR

And CC
then RB
the AT
application NN

the AT

gives VBZ
us PPO
an AT

The AT

This DT

A AT

what WDT

In IN

Such JJ

In IN

The AT

Section NN-TL

the AT

any DTI

such JJ

prior RB

of IN

In IN
analyzing VBG
this DT
regulation NN
, ,
let VB
us PPO
take VB
the AT
last AP
sentence NN
first RB

It PPS
permits VBZ
referrals NNS
under IN
certain AP
circumstances NNS
even RB
when WRB
there EX
is BEZ
a AT
labor NN
dispute NN
, ,
provided VBN
the AT
individual NN

given VBN

of IN
such ABL
a AT

Assume VB
, ,
for IN

a AT
situation NN
where WRB

a AT

The AT

workers NNS

There EX

no AT

We PPSS

( (

provided VBN

So QL

no AT

It PPS

the AT
first OD

it PPS

either CC

condition NN
( (

Employer NN

contended VBN
that CS
the AT
Secretary NN-TL
has HVZ
gone VBN
beyond IN
his PP$
authority NN
by IN
such ABL
a AT
prohibition NN
, ,
on IN
the AT
grounds NNS
that CS
the AT

the AT
prospective JJ

that CS

Into IN-HL

The AT

One CD
of IN
the AT
early JJ

called VBN
by IN
the AT
AWOC NN
was BEDZ
at IN
the AT
DiGiorgio NP

We PPSS

that CS

that CS

workers NNS
had HVD
left VBN
their PP$
jobs NNS

which WDT

then RB
vacant JJ
because RB

Accordingly RB

under IN
clause NN
( (

of IN
the AT
Secretary's NN$-TL
Regulation NN-TL

we PPSS
suspended VBD

( (
Incidentally RB

The AT

challenged VBD
our PP$
right NN

him PPO

in IN
the AT
Superior JJ-TL

Yuba NP-TL

The AT

We PPSS

However RB

at IN
the AT

sought VBD

have HV
the AT
jurisdiction NN
over IN
the AT

removed VBN
to IN
the AT
Federal JJ-TL
District NN-TL
Court NN-TL
, ,
on IN
grounds NNS
that CS
it PPS

predominantly RB
a AT
Federal JJ-TL
issue NN
since CS
the AT
validity NN
of IN

However RB
, ,
the AT
Federal JJ-TL

held VBD
that CS
since CS

accepted VBN
the AT
provisions NNS
of IN
the AT
Wagner-Peyser NP-TL
Act NN-TL
into IN

presumably RB
therefore RB
also RB
the AT

it PPS

It PPS

Under IN

whether CS

The AT

If CS

With IN

First RB

it PPS

based VBN
on IN

fact NN
that CS

Utopia NP-TL

the AT

the AT

More NP

both ABX

That CS
a AT

a AT

many AP

who WPS

the AT

mode NN

Secondly RB

These DTS

A AT

The AT

these DTS

I PPSS

This DT

After IN

perhaps RB
less QL

suddenly RB
jump VB

A AT
chance JJ

the AT

No AT

Three CD

Fromm's NP$

For IN

study NN

The AT-TL
Modern JJ-TL

The AT

conclusions NNS

but CC
subsequent JJ

Another DT

the AT

the AT

For IN
example NN

he PPS

the AT

data NN

two CD

Starting VBG

some DTI

Eric NP
