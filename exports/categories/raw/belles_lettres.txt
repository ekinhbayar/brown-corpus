the AT

On IN

we PPSS

For IN

there EX

If CS

The AT

The AT

The AT

the AT

at IN
what WDT

irreversible JJ
? .
? .
A AT
number NN
of IN
considerations NNS
suggest VB
that CS
this DT
occurs VBZ
early RB
in IN
the AT
process NN
. .
Change NN
involves VBZ
the AT
displacement NN
of IN
form NN

This DT
means VBZ
that CS
the AT
inception NN

change NN
itself PPL
can MD
begin VB
only RB
when WRB
the AT

change NN
have HV
already RB
become VBN
more QL
powerful JJ
than CS
those DTS

If CS

retained VBN
new JJ

be BE
introduced VBN

In IN
the AT

form NN

simply RB
by IN
the AT

Now RB
in IN
the AT
mere JJ
fact NN
of IN
the AT

such JJ

we PPSS

prima-facie JJ
evidence NN

And CC
when WRB

the AT

, ,
any DTI

constitutes VBZ
a AT

of IN

The AT
retention NN
of IN

such ABL
a AT

necessitates VBZ
the AT

However RB

the AT

precisely RB

therefore RB

that CS

The AT

it PPS

As CS

Both ABX

The AT

Its PP$

The AT

Seemingly RB

The AT

that WPS

Such JJ

Moreover RB
its PP$
posture NN

once CS

The AT

The AT

The AT

the AT

Earth NN

Why WRB

This DT

Additional JJ

They PPSS

even RB

Mama NN-TL

Mrs. NP

Every AT

If CS

Speaking VBG

that DT

When WRB

After CS

Ralph NP

manifestly RB

So RB
what WDT

Consequently RB

Fred NP

he PPS

Tom NP

So RB

because CS

less AP

Tom NP

it PPS

felt VBN
proper JJ
that CS

that's DT+BEZ
how WRB

Papa NP

I PPSS

the AT

I'm PPSS+BEM

For IN

Papa NP

I PPSS
recall VB

In IN

Aristotle's NP$

The AT

this DT

moral JJ

we PPSS

We PPSS

better JJR

The AT
other AP
reason NN

is BEZ
that CS

at IN

the AT

Many AP

no AT

Let VB

I PPSS

that CS

For IN

there EX

There EX

too RB
: :
Garibaldi NP
had HVD
been BEN
taken VBN
up RP

Therefore RB
the AT

This DT

that CS

The AT
