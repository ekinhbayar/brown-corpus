It PPS

It PPS

I PPSS

right QL

If CS

For IN

I PPSS

The AT

much QL

once CS

the AT
principles NNS

applied VBN
to IN
any DTI

In IN

are BER
two CD

which WDT
interact VB
with IN
each DT
other AP
to TO
prevent VB
the AT

making VBG

The AT
main JJS
set NN

the AT
`` ``

one CD

If CS

Close QL

These DTS

The AT

how WRB

In IN

`` ``

Two CD

These DTS
slide VB

Here's RB+BEZ
how WRB
the AT
scheme NN
works VBZ
: :
Suppose VB
the AT
operator NN
pulls VBZ
the AT
lever NN
to TO
clear VB
a AT
particular JJ
signal NN
. .
This DT
also RB
pulls VBZ
the AT
tappet NN
connected VBN
to IN
the AT
particular JJ
lever NN
and CC
forces VBZ
any DTI
dogs NNS
seated VBN
in IN
the AT
notches NNS
to IN
the AT
side NN
, ,
thus RB
moving VBG
one CD
or CC
more AP
locking VBG
bars NNS

The AT
dogs NNS
on IN
the AT
other AP
ends NNS
of IN
these DTS
locking VBG
bars NNS
are BER
thus RB
forced VBN
into IN
notches NNS
in IN
other AP
tappets NNS
. .
By IN
this DT
scheme NN
, ,
pulling VBG
one CD
signal NN
to TO
clear VB
locks NNS
all ABN
the AT
other AP
switch NN
and CC
signal NN
levers NNS
in IN
safe JJ
positions NNS
until CS
the AT
first OD
signal NN
is BEZ
again RB
restored VBN
to IN
normal JJ

Interlocking VBG
signals NNS
are BER
normally RB
at IN
stop NN
or CC
`` ``

'' ''
position NN
, ,
and CC
a AT
lever NN
must MD
be BE
pulled VBN
to TO
`` ``

the AT
signal NN

This DT
is BEZ
not *
necessarily RB

however WRB
, ,
for IN
in IN
some DTI
situations NNS
only RB
a AT
yellow JJ
indication NN

given VBN
to IN
a AT

to TO
let VB
it PPO

the AT
`` ``

There EX
are BER
other AP
basic JJ
rules NNS

A AT
turnout NN
may MD
have HV
two CD
levers NNS
, ,
one CD
to TO
actually RB
move VB
the AT
switch NN
points NNS
, ,
the AT

A AT

cannot MD*
be BE
cleared VBN
until CS
all ABN
the AT
related VBN
turnouts NNS
are BER
properly RB
thrown VBN
and CC
locked VBN
. .
Such JJ
locks NNS
are BER
nearly QL
always RB
used VBN
where WRB
the AT
switch NN
points NNS
`` ``
face VB
'' ''
oncoming JJ
traffic NN
. .
The AT
lock NN
insures VBZ
that CS
the AT
points NNS
are BER
thrown VBN
all ABN
the AT
way NN
with IN
no AT
chance NN
that CS
a AT
wheel NN
flange NN
will MD
snag VB
on IN
a AT
partly QL
thrown VBN
point NN

If CS
the AT
points NNS
aren't BER*
thrown VBN
all ABN
the AT

, ,
the AT
Turnout NN-TL
cannot MD*
be BE
locked VBN

and CC
in IN
turn NN

the AT

Generally RB
, ,
these DTS

on IN
turnouts NNS

called VBN
`` ``

In IN

In IN

the AT

Taking VBG
first OD
things NNS
first RB

let's VB+PPO

the AT

It PPS

made VBN
up RP

But CC
the AT
Russians NPS
use VB
gymnastics NNS
as CS
the AT
first OD
step NN
in IN

because CS
it PPS
provides VBZ
training NN
in IN
every AT

The AT

must MD
develop VB
strength NN

courage NN

persistence NN

the AT

In IN

The AT

Another DT
