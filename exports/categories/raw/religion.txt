only RB

If CS

the AT

clearly QL
untenable JJ

Whereas CS
Bultmann's NP$
`` ``

position NN
is BEZ
structurally RB
inconsistent JJ

therefore RB
indefensible JJ
on IN
formal JJ

, ,
the AT

of IN
the AT
`` ``

as CS

say UH

by IN
Karl NP

involves VBZ
the AT
rejection NN

and CC
so RB
is BEZ
invalidated VBN
on IN

we PPSS

It PPS

then RB

provided VBN
the AT

that CS
the AT
only AP

the AT

In IN

we PPSS

this DT

We PPSS

that CS

other AP

the AT
three CD

To TO

this DT

it PPS

sufficient JJ

point VB
out RP
that CS
if CS
the AT
principle NN
in IN

conceived VBN

such JJ

more AP

two CD

then RB
the AT
question NN
of IN
a AT
`` ``
third OD

possibility NN
is BEZ
a AT
meaningless JJ
question NN

Thus RB
, ,
if CS
what WDT

at IN
issue NN
is BEZ
whether CS
`` ``
All ABN
S NN

it PPS

indifferent JJ
whether CS
`` ``

`` ``

'' ''

since CS
in IN
either DTX

the AT

in IN

false JJ

Hence RB
, ,
if CS
what WDT

in IN
question NN

whether CS

it PPS

for CS

in IN

Therefore RB

the AT

those DTS

pseudo JJ
position NN

A AT

It PPS

that CS

This DT

He PPS

why WRB

how WQL

I PPSS
have HV
been BEN
trying VBG
to TO
make VB
this DT
clear JJ
to IN
my PP$

class NN
in IN

One CD
night NN
there EX
were BED
some DTI
dried VBN

lying VBG
on IN
our PP$
kitchen NN

, ,
and CC
these DTS

looked VBD
to IN

like CS
a AT
little AP
group NN

; .
; .
and CC
I PPSS
asked VBD
myself PPL
a AT
question NN
: :
Suppose VB
I PPSS
had HVD
the AT
same AP
number NN
of IN

as CS
there EX
are BER
atoms NNS
in IN
my PP$
body NN
, ,
how WRB
large JJ
an AT

would MD
they PPSS
cover VB
? .
? .
I PPSS
calculated VBD
first RB
that CS
there EX
are BER
about RB
an AT
octillion CD

in IN
the AT

; .

that DT
is BEZ
a AT
figure NN
one CD
with IN
27 CD

, ,
quite ABL
a AT
large JJ
number NN
. .
Then RB
I PPSS
calculated VBD
that CS
a AT
million CD
peas NNS
would MD
just QL
about RB
fill VB
a AT
household NN
refrigerator NN
; .
; .
a AT
billion CD
peas NNS
would MD
fill VB
a AT
small JJ

from IN

; .

a AT

would MD
fill VB
all ABN
the AT

in IN
a AT

of IN
about RB
ten CD
thousand CD
people NNS
; .
; .
and CC
a AT
quadrillion CD
peas NNS
would MD
fill VB
all ABN
the AT

in IN
the AT

of IN
Philadelphia NP

I PPSS
saw VBD
that CS
I PPSS
would MD
soon RB
run VB
out RP
of IN
buildings NNS
at IN
this DT
rate NN
, ,
so CS
I PPSS
decided VBD
to TO
take VB
another DT
measure NN
-- --
the AT
whole JJ
state NN
of IN
Pennsylvania NP

Imagine VB
that CS
there EX
is BEZ
a AT
blizzard NN
over IN
Pennsylvania NP
, ,
but CC
instead RB
of IN
snowing VBG
snow NN
, ,
it PPS
snows VBZ
peas NNS
; .
; .
so CS
we PPSS
get VB
the AT
whole JJ
state NN
covered VBN
with IN
peas NNS
, ,
about RB
four CD
feet NNS
deep JJ
. .
You PPSS
can MD
imagine VB
what WDT
it PPS
would MD
look VB
like CS
going VBG
out RP
on IN
the AT

with IN
the AT

banked VBN
up RP

the AT

and CC
covering VBG
the AT

; .
; .
Pennsylvania NP
thus RB
blanketed VBN
would MD
contain VB
about RB
a AT
quintillion CD

But CC
we PPSS
still RB
have HV
a AT
long JJ
way NN
to TO
go VB

Next RB
we PPSS
imagine VB
our PP$
blizzard NN
raging VBG
over IN

the AT

the AT

and CC
Africa NP

all QL
covered VBN
with IN
peas NNS
four CD
feet NNS
deep JJ
; .
; .
then RB
we PPSS
have HV
sextillion CD
peas NNS
. .
Next RB
we PPSS
freeze VB
over RP
the AT
oceans NNS
and CC
cover VB
the AT
whole JJ
earth NN
with IN
peas NNS
, ,
then RB
we PPSS
go VB
out RP
among IN
the AT
neighboring VBG
stars NNS
, ,
collect VB
250 CD
planets NNS
each DT
the AT
size NN
of IN
the AT
earth NN
, ,
and CC
also RB
cover VB
each DT
of IN
these DTS
with IN
peas NNS
four CD
feet NNS
deep JJ
; .
; .
and CC
then RB
we PPSS
have HV
septillion CD
. .
Finally RB
we PPSS
go VB
into IN
the AT
farthest JJT
reaches NNS
of IN
the AT
Milky JJ-TL
Way NN-TL
; .
; .
we PPSS
get VB
250,000 CD
planets NNS
; .
; .
we PPSS
cover VB
each DT
of IN
these DTS
with IN
our PP$
blanket NN
of IN
peas NNS
and CC
then RB
at IN
last RB
we PPSS
have HV
octillion CD
peas NNS
corresponding VBG
in IN
number NN
to IN
the AT
atoms NNS
in IN
the AT
body NN

So RB
you PPSS
see VB
how WQL
small JJ
an AT
atom NN
is BEZ
and CC
how WQL
complicated VBN
you PPSS
are BER

A AT-HL

Now RB
although CS
an AT

is BEZ
small JJ
, ,
we PPSS
can MD
still RB
in IN
imagination NN
have HV
a AT
look NN
at IN
it PPO

Let VB
us PPO
focus VB
on IN
an AT
atom NN
of IN
calcium NN
from IN
the AT
tip NN
of IN
the AT
bone NN
of IN
my PP$

and CC
let VB
us PPO
suppose VB
that CS
I PPSS
swallow VB
a AT
magic JJ
Alice NP
In IN-TL
Wonderland NP

I PPSS
start VB
growing VBG
rapidly RB
and CC
this DT
calcium NN
atom NN
grows VBZ
along RB

me PPO

I PPSS
shoot VB
up RP

through IN

out RP

until CS
I PPSS
am BEM
over RP

fifty CD
million CD

. .
Then RB
this DT
atom NN
of IN
calcium NN
will MD
swell VB
to IN
something PN
like CS
a AT

a AT

across IN

a AT

big JJ
enough QLP
to TO
put VB
a AT

And CC
if CS
you PPSS
should MD
step VB
inside RB
of IN
such ABL
a AT
magnified VBN
atom NN
, ,
according IN
to IN
the AT
physics NN
of IN
forty CD
years NNS
ago RB
, ,
you PPSS
would MD
see VB
circulating VBG
over IN
your PP$

down RP
at IN
the AT

and CC
under IN
your PP$
feet NNS
, ,
some DTI
twenty CD
luminous JJ

about RB
the AT

of IN

These DTS
balls NNS
are BER
moving VBG
in IN
great JJ
circles NNS
and CC
ellipses NNS
, ,
and CC
are BER
of IN

, ,
the AT

the AT

of IN
negative JJ
electricity NN
which WDT

their PP$

create VB
the AT
forces NNS
that WPS
tie VB
this DT
atom NN

calcium NN

the AT
neighboring VBG
atoms NNS
of IN
oxygen NN
and CC
make VB
up RP
the AT
solid NN
structure NN
of IN
my PP$

Since CS
these DTS
electrons NNS
are BER
moving VBG
like CS

, ,
you PPSS
may MD
wonder VB
whether CS
there EX
is BEZ
an AT
atomic JJ
sun NN
at IN
the AT
center NN
of IN
the AT
atom NN

So CS
you PPSS
look VB
down RP
there RB
and CC
you PPSS
see VB
a AT
tiny JJ
, ,
whirling VBG
point NN
about RB
the AT

the AT

of IN
a AT

This DT
is BEZ
the AT

the AT

Even RB
if CS
the AT
atom NN
were BED
big JJ
enough QLP

hold VB
a AT

field NN
, ,
this DT
nucleus NN
is BEZ
still RB
only RB
about RB
the AT

of IN
a AT

It PPS
is BEZ
this DT

nucleus NN
that WPS

the AT

holding VBG
these DTS
negatively RB

; .
; .
it PPS
also RB
contains VBZ
nearly RB
all ABN
the AT

and CC
the AT

You PPSS
may MD
ask VB
what WDT
else RB
there EX
is BEZ
, ,
and CC
the AT
answer NN
is BEZ
nothing PN
-- --
nothing PN
but IN
empty JJ

And CC
since CS
you PPSS
are BER
made VBN
of IN
atoms NNS
, ,
you PPSS
are BER
nothing PN
much AP
but IN
empty JJ
space NN
, ,
too RB

If CS
I PPSS

put VB
your PP$

in IN
an AT
imaginary JJ
atomic JJ

and CC
squeeze VB
you PPO
down RP
, ,
squeeze VB
these DTS

out IN
of IN
you PPO
in IN
the AT
way NN
we PPSS
squeeze VB
the AT

out IN
of IN
a AT

, ,
you PPSS
would MD
get VB
smaller JJR

smaller JJR
until CS
finally RB
when WRB
the AT

, ,
you PPSS

the AT

that WPS
you PPSS

Someone PN

that CS

certainly RB
the AT
ultimate JJ

At IN

it PPS

Now RB
this DT
1920 CD
view NN
of IN
the AT
atom NN
was BEDZ
on IN
the AT
whole NN
a AT
discouraging JJ
picture NN

For CS
we PPSS
believed VBD
that CS
the AT
electrons NNS
obeyed VBD
the AT
law NN
of IN
mechanics NNS
and CC
electrodynamics NN
; .
; .
and CC
therefore RB
the AT
atom NN
was BEDZ
really RB
just RB
a AT

; .

and CC
in IN
mechanics NNS
the AT
whole NN
is BEZ
no AT
more AP

the AT

So CS
if CS
you PPSS
are BER
made VBN

, ,
you PPSS
are BER
just RB
a AT
big JJ

; .
; .
and CC
since CS
the AT

also RB

it PPS

just RB
a AT

And CC
this DT

mean VB
that CS

governed VBN

that WPS

And CC
this DT

why WRB
so QL
many AP

Then RB

the AT

A AT
suggestion NN
from IN
Louis NP

a AT

in IN
France NP

showed VBD
us PPO
that CS
these DTS

not *

And CC
to TO
see VB
the AT
meaning NN
of IN
this DT

imagine VB
that CS
you PPSS

put VB

more QL

and CC
have HV
a AT

at IN
it PPO
in IN

we PPSS
view VB

today NR

Now RB
as CS
you PPSS
step VB
inside IN

instead RB
of IN
seeing VBG

like CS

you PPSS

These DTS

you PPSS
