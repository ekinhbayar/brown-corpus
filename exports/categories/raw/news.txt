what WDT

such ABL
a AT
hot JJ
one CD
? .
? .
The AT
answer NN
is BEZ
that CS
it PPS
was BEDZ
a AT
combination NN
of IN
circumstances NNS

First RB
, ,
the AT
general JJ

boiling VBG
upward RB
for IN
the AT
last AP
few AP

As CS
a AT

it PPS
is BEZ
not *
easy JJ

Second RB
, ,
the AT
`` ``

has HVZ
caught VBN
the AT
fancy NN
of IN

lately RB

both ABX

bases NNS

Morton NP

and CC
everyone PN

anything PN

it PPO
expected VBD
the AT
Morton NP

a AT
fast JJ

And CC
third RB
, ,
the AT
potato NN

has HVZ
taken VBN
on RP
the AT
flavor NN
of IN
a AT
`` ``

have HV

The AT

these DTS

The AT

that CS

But CC
today NR
many AP

90% NN

it PPS

wound VBD

or CC
some DTI

dismal JJ

had HVD

I've PPSS+HV
tried VBN

When WRB

that DT
my PP$

She PPS

my PP$

who WPS

Even RB
that DT

satisfactory JJ

If CS
they PPSS

they'd PPSS+MD
rather RB
take VB

one CD

They PPSS

Gloriana NP

when WRB
Gloriana NP

they PPSS
also RB
have HV

take VB
the AT
two CD

who WPS
usually RB

so CS
the AT

enough QLP

The AT

impeccable JJ

The AT

The AT

If CS

that CS
the AT

Disapproval NN

After IN

it PPS

Mr. NP

Moreover RB

the AT
