At IN

for CS
by IN

Barco NP

The AT

Thus RB
it PPS

During IN

The AT

However WRB

Barco NP

in IN

made VBD
an AT

The AT

when WRB
endeavoring VBG

this DT
murderer NN

seven CD

had HVD
fainted VBN

The AT

attaching VBG

offered VBD

the AT

refused VBD

no AT

Then RB
it PPS

that CS
District NN-TL
Attorney NN-TL

A AT

nothing PN

him PPO
which WDT

It PPS

reported VBN

Welch's NP$

that CS

Welch NP
wanted VBD

No AT

Now RB
Welch NP

that CS

The AT

looked VBD

him PPO
like CS
an AT

So CS
he PPS
paid VBD

Barco NP

At IN

Barco NP

By IN

Welch NP

But CC
to IN
Welch's NP$
chagrin NN

the AT

pooh-poohed VBD
Welch's NP$

Barco NP
