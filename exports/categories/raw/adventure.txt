The AT

He PPS

He PPS

The AT

One CD

This DT

I PPSS

I PPSS

I PPSS

I PPSS

constantly RB
searching VBG

Though CS
only RB
a AT

its PP$

Large JJ

the AT

The AT

only RB

an AT

Sometimes RB

the AT

The AT

The AT

It PPS

Its PP$

I PPSS

But CC

For IN

I PPSS

I PPSS
returned VBD

despite IN

As CS
I PPSS

he PPS

Meanwhile RB

At IN

when WRB

the AT

When WRB

he PPS

I PPSS

though CS

The AT

that CS

When WRB

I PPSS

Although CS

Cigarette NN

The AT

the AT

I PPSS

The AT

itself PPL

echoing VBG
the AT

I PPSS
stopped VBD

No AT

in IN
the AT

I PPSS

The AT

I PPSS
rapped VBD

The AT

I PPSS

just RB
what WDT

He PPS

they PPSS

But CC
he PPS

offered VBD

then RB

I PPSS

the AT

perhaps RB

He PPS

As CS

I PPSS

He PPS

Why WRB

Begging VBG

He PPS

indeed RB

my PP$

These DTS

I PPSS

that CS

Though CS
I PPSS

I PPSS

I PPSS

This DT

I PPSS
went VBD

growing VBG
voluble JJ
as CS

its PP$

To IN

I PPSS

The AT

It PPS

really RB
a AT

My PP$

There EX

there EX

the AT

You PPSS

forgive VB
me PPO
if CS
I PPSS

physical JJ
aspects NNS

I PPSS
am BEM
an AT

, ,
accustomed VBN

the AT

The AT
true JJ

The AT

And CC
that DT

the AT

I PPSS
first RB

her PPO
when WRB
my PP$

That CS
she PPS

I PPSS

that CS
when WRB
our PP$

met VBD
we PPSS
both ABX
quickly RB
averted VBD

I PPSS
thought VBD
I PPSS
saw VBD
a AT
faint JJ

rise VB

her PP$

quickly RB

her PP$

True RB

she PPS

my PP$
Aunt NN-TL

married VBN
to IN
an AT
Uncle NN-TL
related VBD
to IN
me PPO
only RB
by IN

but CC
why WRB
she PPS

married VBN
a AT

twice RB
her PP$

and CC
more AP
, ,
perhaps RB
, ,
I PPSS
did DOD
not *

She PPS
was BEDZ
standing VBG
with IN
her PP$

the AT

Her PP$

silhouetted VBN

with IN
the AT
strong JJ

I PPSS

a AT
body NN
that CS
an AT

anyone PN
else RB
would MD
have HV
admired VBN

As CS
it PPS
is BEZ
in IN
so QL
many AP
affairs NNS
of IN
the AT
heart NN

a AT

a AT

meet VB

something PN

Something PN

this DT

but CC
I PPSS
treated VBD

I PPSS
felt VBD
that CS

for CS
we PPSS
both ABX
kept VBD
our PP$

When WRB
she PPS
appeared VBD
at IN
the AT

to TO
help VB
out RP
for IN
a AT
few AP
hours NNS
even VB
my PP$
looking NN
at IN
her PPO
was BEDZ
surreptitious JJ
lest CS
my PP$
Uncle NN-TL
notice VB
it PPO

And CC
then RB
I PPSS
became VBD
aware JJ
that CS
she PPS
, ,
too RB
, ,
glanced VBD
at IN
me PPO
surreptitiously RB
. .
I PPSS
felt VBD
that CS
her PP$
eyes NNS
were BED
undressing VBG
me PPO
as CS
if CS
she PPS
were BED
a AT
painter NN
and CC
I PPSS
a AT
nude JJ

I PPSS
dismissed VBD
these DTS
feelings NNS
as CS
wishful JJ
thinking NN
but CC
I PPSS
could MD
not *
get VB
it PPO
out IN
of IN
my PP$
head NN
that CS
we PPSS
had HVD
a AT
strong JJ
physical JJ
attraction NN
for IN
one DTX
another DT
and CC
we PPSS
both ABX
feared VBD
to TO
dwell VB
on IN
it PPO
because CS
of IN
our PP$
relationship NN

When WRB
our PP$

met VBD
the AT
air NN
was BEDZ
filled VBN
with IN
an AT
unuttered JJ
message NN
of IN
`` ``

You PPSS
have HV
probably RB
experienced VBN
this DT

It PPS
is BEZ
nothing PN
you PPSS

put VB
your PP$
fingers NNS
on RP
but CC
the AT
air NN
suddenly RB
fills VBZ
with IN
a AT
high JJ
charge NN
of IN
electricity NN

Why WRB
she PPS
married VBD
him PPO
I PPSS
do DO
not *
know VB

I PPSS
myself PPL
was BEDZ
fond JJ
of IN
him PPO
but CC
what WDT
a AT
young JJ
woman NN
half ABN
his PP$

saw VBD

him PPO

a AT
mystery NN
to IN
me PPO

He PPS
already RB
had HVD
that DT
slow JJ

that WPS

over IN
the AT
elderly JJ

while CS
she PPS
herself PPL
had HVD
all ABN
the AT
signs NNS
of IN
one PN
who WPS
appreciates VBZ
the AT
joys NNS
of IN
living VBG

Perhaps RB
, ,
with IN
my PP$
Uncle NN-TL
, ,
she PPS
found VBD
a AT
measure NN

economic JJ

that WPS
she PPS

maybe RB
she PPS

old JJ
enough QLP

her PP$

some DTI

For IN
several AP

we PPSS

one DTX

almost RB

then RB
one CD

Uncle NN-TL

his PP$

I PPSS

Even RB

I PPSS
became VBD
aware JJ

a AT

that WPS
suffused VBD
her PP$

and CC
moved VBD
upwards RB
to IN
her PP$

subconsciously RB
I PPSS
realized VBD
that CS
when WRB

entered VBD
the AT

she PPS

The AT
cavernous JJ

echoed VBD

I PPSS

I PPSS

I PPSS

suddenly RB

I PPSS

Matsuo NP

Five CD
