Marty NP

After CS

For IN

Even RB

The AT

A AT

He PPS

The AT

Marty NP

The AT

She PPS

Stanley NP

It PPS
no AT

The AT

A AT

Poet NN-TL

Another DT

For IN

The AT

Nick NP

Someday RB

Meanwhile RB

Sometimes RB
the AT

Why WRB

Strolling VBG

the AT

called VBN
out RP

him PPO
a AT

His PP$

had HVD

involuntary JJ

something PN
anybody PN

on IN

As CS

he PPS
wouldn't MD*
have HV

at IN
all ABN
if CS
the AT

Actually RB
, ,
he PPS
regretted VBD
having HVG
opened VBN
his PP$
mouth NN
when WRB
the AT
truck NN
came VBD
to IN
a AT
stop NN
and CC
the AT
angry JJ
driver NN
jumped VBD
down RP
from IN
the AT
cab NN
and CC
walked VBD
back RB
toward IN
them PPO

By IN
then RB
, ,
the AT
stranger NN
was BEDZ
thanking VBG
Haney NP
profusely RB
and CC
had HVD
one CD
arm NN
around IN
his PP$
shoulders NNS
as CS
if CS

an AT

So CS
the AT
driver NN
started VBD
to TO
curse VB
at IN
both ABX

as CS
if CS
they PPSS
had HVD
been BEN
in IN
a AT
plot NN
together RB
to TO
ruin VB
his PP$

record NN

Then RB
the AT
man NN
he PPS
saved VBD
turned VBD
and CC
looked VBD
squarely RB
into IN
the AT
truck NN
driver's NN$
face NN
, ,
without IN

a AT

Very QL
suddenly RB
, ,
the AT
driver NN
stopped VBD
swearing VBG
at IN
them PPO
, ,
turned VBD
on IN
his PP$
heel NN
and CC
went VBD
back RB
to IN
his PP$
truck NN

Haney NP
hadn't HVD*
given VBN
it PPO
much AP
thought NN
at IN
the AT
time NN

Now RB
he PPS
recalled VBD
it PPO
very QL
clearly RB

and CC
wondered VBD
what WDT
the AT
truck NN
driver NN
had HVD
seen VBN
in IN
those DTS

to TO
make VB

back VB
off RP

It PPS

the AT

that WPS

call VB

without IN

When WRB
the AT

went VBD
their PP$

they PPSS
went VBD
on RP
across IN

And CC
when WRB
the AT

found VBD
out RP
that CS
Phil NP

on IN

to IN
one CD

he PPS
insisted VBD

Phil NP
usually RB
went VBD
alone RB

sitting VBG

passing VBG
the AT

nursing VBG

But CC
he PPS

even RB

he PPS
made VBD

money NN
at IN

Phil NP

Now RB
he PPS

having HVG
a AT

He PPS
really RB

take VB

but CC
he PPS
began VBD

uneasy JJ

When WRB
he PPS
finally RB

he PPS
realized VBD

still RB
waiting VBG

Haney NP

`` ``

Maybe RB
