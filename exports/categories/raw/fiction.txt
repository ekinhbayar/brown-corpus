She PPS

Then RB

It PPS

There EX

The AT

After CS

the AT

The AT

The AT

When WRB

Wilson NP

The AT

After CS

An AT

She PPS

She PPS

They PPSS

both ABX
so QL
young JJ

after IN

so QL

How WRB

it PPO

thirty CD

she PPS

But CC
yes RB
, ,
nineteen CD

thirty CD

forty-nine CD

and CC
she PPS
was BEDZ
forty-nine CD

she PPS

She PPS
stood VBD
still RB

quite QL
suddenly RB
conscious JJ

a AT

that WPS

But CC
they PPSS
all ABN

`` ``

your PP$

There EX

no AT

tiny JJ
Weaning VBG-TL

( (
where WRB

So RB
when WRB

the AT

So RB
Linda NP

Without IN

she PPS

for CS

she PPS

She PPS

She PPS

People NNS

in IN

Bobby NP
Joe NP

gone VBN
all ABN
day NN
now RB
, ,
not *
coming VBG
in RP

and CC
sometimes RB
not *

When WRB
they PPSS
first RB
married VBD
he PPS
had HVD
been BEN
working VBG
in IN
the AT

all ABN
day NN
, ,
and CC

to TO
take VB

a AT

Now RB
there EX

no AT

in IN

nor CC

till CS
it PPS

she PPS

not *

where WRB
he PPS

Not *
that CS
she PPS
complained VBD

any DTI

Four CD

five CD
of IN
the AT

East JJ-TL
Texas NP-TL

about RB
his PP$

so RB
naturally RB
they PPSS

around RB
together RB

There EX
was BEDZ
no AT
reason NN
for IN
her PPO
to TO
ask VB
what WDT
they PPSS

Thus RB
a AT
new JJ
pattern NN
of IN
days NNS
began VBD
to TO
develop VB
, ,
for CS
Granny NP
Albright NP
did DOD
not *
die VB

She PPS
lay VBD
still RB

her PP$

hardly RB

; .
sometimes RB
she PPS

looked VBD
around RB

and CC
sometimes RB
she PPS
took VBD
a AT
little AP
milk NN

soup NN

They PPSS
stopped VBD
expecting VBG
her PPO
to TO
die VB
the AT
next AP

, ,
but CC
only RB
in IN
the AT
next AP
day NN
or CC
two CD

Those DTS
who WPS

driven VBN
hundreds NNS

miles NNS
for IN
the AT

not *
go VB

for CS

but CC
they PPSS

as QL
well RB

for CS
she PPS

So CS
the AT

When WRB
Linda NP

There EX

that DT

Bobby NP

The AT

before CS

took VBD
their PP$

off RP

the AT

or CC
drove VBD

The AT

Albrights' NPS$

The AT

low JJ
as CS

The AT

someone PN

The AT

her PP$

so CS

the AT

there EX

The AT

the AT
